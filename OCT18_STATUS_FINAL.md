## ⚠️ **Known Issues**

### **1. API Showing 0 Runners**

**Symptom:** API returns races but with 0 runners

**Root Cause:** Server autoupdate is overwriting fresh data with cached data

**Solution:** Disable cache or force refresh

### **2. "Unknown Course" (9 races)**

One meeting showing as NULL - need to identify and fix course_id

### **3. Duplicate Race IDs Changing**

- Old race_ids (810612, 810635) no longer exist
- New race_ids (811XXX range) created after re-fetch
- UI references to old IDs will 404

## 🔧 **What Works**

### **Betfair Price Updater:**

```bash
cd /home/smonaghan/GiddyUp/backend-api
source ../settings.env
./bin/update_live_prices --date=2025-10-18 --continuous --interval=30
```

**Output:**
```
✅ Logged in to Betfair
✅ Found 52 markets
✅ Updated 500 runners
📊 Coverage: 98.2%
```

### **Betting Script Readiness:**

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE win_ppwap IS NOT NULL) as ready,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE win_ppwap IS NOT NULL) / COUNT(*)) as pct
FROM racing.runners
WHERE race_date = '2025-10-18';

Result: 500/509 (98%) ✅ READY
```

## 📋 **For Your Quants**

### **Database Query They Can Use:**

```sql
SELECT 
    r.race_id,
    c.course_name,
    r.off_time,
    h.horse_name,
    ru.win_ppwap as betfair_price,  ← This is populated!
    ru.betfair_selection_id,
    t.trainer_name,
    j.jockey_name,
    
    -- Calculate market rank
    RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY r.race_id 
        ORDER BY ru.win_ppwap
    ) as market_rank
    
FROM racing.runners ru
JOIN racing.races r ON r.race_id = ru.race_id
LEFT JOIN racing.courses c ON c.course_id = r.course_id
LEFT JOIN racing.horses h ON h.horse_id = ru.horse_id
LEFT JOIN racing.trainers t ON t.trainer_id = ru.trainer_id
LEFT JOIN racing.jockeys j ON j.jockey_id = ru.jockey_id
WHERE r.race_date = '2025-10-18'
AND ru.win_ppwap IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY r.off_time, market_rank;
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Tonight:**
1. ✅ Price updater running (updates every 30 mins)
2. ⏳ Prices will continue updating overnight
3. ⏳ Coverage may improve to 99-100% by morning

### **Tomorrow Morning (8 AM):**

```bash
# 1. Check readiness
cd /home/smonaghan/GiddyUp
./CHECK_BETTING_READINESS.sh 2025-10-18

# 2. Run betting script
cd /home/smonaghan/GiddyUpModel/giddyup
./get_tomorrows_bets.sh 2025-10-18
```

**Expected:** 2-5 bet recommendations from 500 runners with prices

## 💡 **About win_ppwap**

**What it is:** Pre-Play Volume-Weighted Average Price

**Formula:**
```
PPWAP = Σ(matched_stake × odds) / Σ(matched_stake)
```

**For Tomorrow's Races:**
- True PPWAP doesn't exist yet (race hasn't happened)
- Using **current live price** as proxy
- Will be more accurate as market develops
- Continuous updates every 30 mins improve accuracy

**After Race Finishes:**
- Download Betfair CSV (next day)
- Get true PPWAP from historical data
- Update database with actual weighted average
