## How It Works

### Pipeline (4 Steps)

1. **Load Races from Database**
   - Queries all races for the specified date
   - Loads runners with foreign key IDs
   - Builds `raceIDMap` for matching

2. **Discover Betfair Markets**
   - Calls Betfair API-NG `listMarketCatalogue`
   - Filters for UK/IRE horse racing WIN markets
   - Returns market catalog with selection IDs

3. **Match Races to Markets**
   - Uses `internal/betfair/matcher.go` (same as auto-update)
   - Matches by: `DATE|REGION|COURSE|TIME|NAME|TYPE`
   - Creates mapping: `marketID → raceID` and `selectionID → runnerID`

4. **Fetch Live Prices**
   - Calls Betfair API-NG `listMarketBook` in batches (10 markets at a time)
   - Extracts back price, lay price, VWAP for each runner
   - Inserts into `racing.live_prices` table with timestamp
   - Mirrors latest prices to `racing.runners` table

### Key Features

✅ **Reuses existing code** - Same logic as `internal/services/liveprices.go`  
✅ **Same API calls** - Uses `betfair.Client.ListMarketBook()`  
✅ **Same price extraction** - Identical `extractPrices()` function  
✅ **Same database schema** - Uses `racing.live_prices` table  
✅ **Batching** - Fetches 10 markets at a time to avoid API limits  
✅ **Time filtering** - Only fetches active races (before off+30min)  
✅ **Error handling** - Graceful batch failures with warnings

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
cd backend-api

# Fetch live prices for today
./fetch_all_betfair $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Fetch live prices for specific date
./fetch_all_betfair 2025-10-16

# Using flag syntax
./fetch_all_betfair --date 2025-10-17
```

### Prerequisites

1. **Race data exists** - Run `fetch_all` first:
   ```bash
   ./fetch_all 2025-10-16
   ./fetch_all_betfair 2025-10-16
   ```

2. **Betfair credentials** - Set in `settings.env`:
   ```bash
   export BETFAIR_APP_KEY=your_app_key
   export BETFAIR_SESSION_TOKEN=your_token
   # OR
   export BETFAIR_USERNAME=your_username
   export BETFAIR_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

3. **Active markets** - Only works for races before off_time + 30 minutes

### Common Workflows

#### Daily Live Price Refresh
```bash
# Morning: Fetch Sporting Life data
./fetch_all $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Throughout day: Fetch live prices as needed
./fetch_all_betfair $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

#### Test Betfair Integration
```bash
# Verify credentials and matching
./fetch_all_betfair 2025-10-16
```

#### Debug Market Matching
```bash
# Check logs for matching details
./fetch_all_betfair 2025-10-16 2>&1 | grep -E "(Matched|No Betfair)"
```

## Integration with Auto-Update Service

| Component | fetch_all_betfair | Auto-Update Service |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Trigger** | Manual (on-demand) | Automatic (every 60s) |
| **Source** | `cmd/fetch_all_betfair/main.go` | `internal/services/liveprices.go` |
| **Market Discovery** | `betfair.Matcher.FindTodaysMarkets()` | Same |
| **Matching** | `betfair.Matcher.MatchRacesToMarkets()` | Same |
| **Price Fetch** | `betfair.Client.ListMarketBook()` | Same |
| **Price Extraction** | `extractPrices()` (copied) | `extractPrices()` (original) |
| **Database Insert** | `racing.live_prices` | `racing.live_prices` |
| **Mirror to Runners** | Yes | Yes |
| **Batching** | 10 markets at a time | All markets at once |
| **Use Case** | Testing, manual refresh, backfill | Continuous live updates |

**Key difference:** One-shot execution vs continuous loop.

## Database Tables Updated

### racing.live_prices

Time-series table storing price snapshots:

```sql
CREATE TABLE racing.live_prices (
    race_id INTEGER,
    runner_id INTEGER,
    ts TIMESTAMP,  -- Snapshot timestamp
    back_price NUMERIC(10,2),  -- Best back odds
    lay_price NUMERIC(10,2),   -- Best lay odds
    vwap NUMERIC(10,2),         -- Volume-weighted average price
    traded_vol NUMERIC(15,2),   -- Total matched volume
    PRIMARY KEY (runner_id, ts)
);
```

### racing.runners

Mirrored latest prices (non-destructive):

```sql
UPDATE racing.runners SET
    win_ppwap = latest_vwap,           -- Latest VWAP
    win_ppmax = MAX(current, latest),  -- Highest back price seen
    win_ppmin = MIN(current, latest)   -- Lowest lay price seen
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No races found in database"
→ Run `fetch_all` first to populate Sporting Life data

### "No races matched to Betfair markets"
→ Check date format (YYYY-MM-DD)  
→ Verify races exist in database  
→ Check Betfair has markets for that date

### "API error -32099: ANGX-0001"
→ Session token expired (re-authenticate)  
→ Or too many markets requested (batching should prevent this)

### "No active markets to fetch"
→ All races have finished (past off_time + 30min)  
→ This is normal for historical dates

### "Mirror to runners failed"
→ Check database connectivity  
→ Verify `racing.runners` table exists
