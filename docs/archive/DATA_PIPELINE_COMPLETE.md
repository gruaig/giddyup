## 🔧 **PROBLEMS SOLVED**

### 1. Root Cause: Betfair Miscategorization (CRITICAL)
**Problem:**
- 7,632 jumps races were in flat folders in `betfair_stitched`
- Caused 6,614 duplicate race_keys in master files
- Loader failed on every attempt with `ON CONFLICT` errors

**Solution:**
- Created `reclassify_betfair_stitched.py` to reclassify by event_name keywords
- Moved 7,632 races from flat → jumps folders
- Classification keywords: chs, hrd, hurdle, chase, nhf, hunt

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

### 2. Stitcher Using Unreliable Type Field
**Problem:**
- Racing Post `type` field was incorrect (Chase races labeled as "Flat")
- Stitcher filtered by this field, creating duplicates

**Solution:**
- Updated `fixed_stitcher_2024_2025.py` (lines 103-111)
- Now classifies by `race_name` keywords instead
- Example: "Irish Grand National **Chase**" → classified as jumps

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

### 3. Data Quality Issues in CSVs
**Problem:**
- Currency symbols (€, £, $) causing parse errors
- Em-dashes (–, —) instead of proper minus signs
- Standalone "-" values failing numeric conversions

**Solution:**
- Python script cleaned all 84 CSV files
- Removed: €, £, $, –, —
- Converted standalone "-" to empty (NULL)

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

### 4. BSP Check Constraint Violations
**Problem:**
- BSP constraint requires `>= 1.01`
- 37,395 values were exactly `1.0` (Betfair "no price" indicator)

**Solution:**
- Converted all BSP/price values `<= 1.0` to NULL
- Fixed 37,395 values across all CSVs

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

### 5. Loader ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE Failures
**Problem:**
- `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` fails with partitioned tables when batch has duplicates
- Error: "cannot affect row a second time"

**Solution:**
- Changed `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` to `DO NOTHING` (lines 278, 366)
- Now skips existing data instead of trying to update

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

## 🛠️ **FILES CREATED/MODIFIED**

### Scripts Created
1. **`/home/smonaghan/rpscrape/reclassify_betfair_stitched.py`**
