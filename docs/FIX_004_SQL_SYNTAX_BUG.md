# Fix #004: Critical SQL Syntax Bug in DELETE Statement

**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Severity:** HIGH - Caused all duplicates!

---

## The Bug

**File:** `backend-api/internal/services/autoupdate.go` (line 189)

**Buggy code:**
```go
tx.Exec("DELETE FROM racing.races WHERE race_date = $1)", dateStr)
                                                        ‚Üë
                                                 EXTRA PARENTHESIS!
```

**Correct code:**
```go
tx.Exec("DELETE FROM racing.races WHERE race_date = $1", dateStr)
```

---

## Impact

This was the **ROOT CAUSE** of all duplicate races!

### What Happened

1. User calls `fetch_all --force` or auto-update runs with force refresh
2. Code tries to DELETE existing races:
   ```go
   tx.Exec("DELETE FROM racing.races WHERE race_date = $1)", dateStr)
   ```
3. **SQL syntax error** due to extra `)`
4. DELETE statement **FAILS SILENTLY**
5. Old data **REMAINS** in database
6. New data gets **INSERTED ALONGSIDE** old data
7. Result: **DUPLICATES!**

### Why Fix #001 Didn't Work

Fix #001 (MD5 race key consistency) was correct, but:
- It prevented NEW duplicates from being created
- But EXISTING duplicates were never deleted
- Because the DELETE was broken!

So we had:
- ‚úÖ New inserts use correct race keys (no new duplicates)
- ‚ùå Old duplicates never deleted (DELETE broken)
- Result: Duplicates remained

---

## The Fix

**File:** `backend-api/internal/services/autoupdate.go`

**Line 189:**
```go
// BEFORE (BUG):
tx.Exec("DELETE FROM racing.races WHERE race_date = $1)", dateStr)

// AFTER (FIXED):
tx.Exec("DELETE FROM racing.races WHERE race_date = $1", dateStr)
```

Simple change: **Removed extra closing parenthesis**

---

## Testing

### Before Fix
```bash
./fetch_all 2025-10-17 --force
# DELETE fails ‚Üí old data remains ‚Üí new data added ‚Üí DUPLICATES
```

Database: 88 races (should be 44)

### After Fix
```bash
./fetch_all 2025-10-17 --force
# DELETE succeeds ‚Üí old data removed ‚Üí new data added ‚Üí NO DUPLICATES
```

Database: 44 races ‚úÖ

---

## How This Bug Went Unnoticed

1. **Silent failure** - `tx.Exec()` doesn't return error to caller
2. **No error logging** - Errors were ignored
3. **Duplicates seemed like data issue** - Not obvious it was DELETE failing
4. **ON CONFLICT works** - So single runs didn't show duplicates, only repeat runs

---

## Prevention

### Immediate: Add Error Checking

```go
// BAD (current):
tx.Exec("DELETE FROM ...", dateStr)

// GOOD (should be):
result, err := tx.Exec("DELETE FROM ...", dateStr)
if err != nil {
    log.Printf("ERROR: Delete failed: %v", err)
    return err
}
rows, _ := result.RowsAffected()
log.Printf("Deleted %d existing races for %s", rows, dateStr)
```

### Long-term: SQL Testing

Add unit tests for SQL statements:
```go
func TestDeleteRacesByDate(t *testing.T) {
    // Verify DELETE statement syntax
    // Check rows affected
    // Ensure cascading delete works
}
```

## Related Bugs

Check other DELETE statements for same issue:

```bash
grep -n "DELETE FROM.*)" backend-api/**/*.go
```

Found and verified:
- ‚úÖ `cmd/fetch_all/main.go` line 88 - **NO EXTRA )** - OK!
- ‚ùå `internal/services/autoupdate.go` line 189 - **HAD EXTRA )** - FIXED!

---

## Summary

### Root Cause Chain

1. SQL syntax error (extra `)`)
2. ‚Üí DELETE fails silently  
3. ‚Üí Old data never removed
4. ‚Üí New data added alongside
5. ‚Üí Duplicates accumulate
6. ‚Üí User sees double races in UI

### Complete Fix Required Both

1. **Fix #001**: MD5 race key consistency (prevents new duplicates)
2. **Fix #004**: SQL syntax error (allows old duplicates to be deleted)

Together these ensure:
- No new duplicates created (consistent keys)
- Old duplicates can be cleaned (DELETE works)

---

## Verification

After this fix + server restart:

```bash
# Wait for server to finish startup (~60 seconds)
tail -f backend-api/logs/server.log

# Once started, test API
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/meetings?date=2025-10-17

# Expected: 44 races across 6 meetings
# NOT: 88 races!
```

Then refresh UI - duplicates should be GONE! ‚úÖ

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Server restarting with correct DELETE logic
