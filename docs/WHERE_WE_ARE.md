# GiddyUp - Current Status
**Time**: October 16, 2025, 7:58 AM BST

## 🎯 Where We Are

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Sporting Life API Integration** - Using clean REST endpoints
   - `https://www.sportinglife.com/api/horse-racing/racing/racecards/{date}`
   - `https://www.sportinglife.com/api/horse-racing/race/{raceID}`
   
2. **Auto-Update Service** - Correctly handles date rotation
   - TODAY (Oct 16): 31 races, 280 runners ✅
   - TOMORROW (Oct 17): 36 races, 306 runners ✅
   - Historical (Oct 11-14): Loaded with Betfair BSP ✅

3. **All API Endpoints** - Working
   - Horse profiles ✅
   - Races ✅
   - Meetings ✅
   - Search ✅

### ⚠️ Current Issue: Betfair Matching
**Problem**: 0/31 races matched with Betfair markets

**Root Cause**: `off_time` format issue
- Database shows: `0000-01-01T19:30:00Z` (wrong!)
- Should be: `19:30:00` (time only, no date)

**Why**: The Sporting Life scraper is setting `OffTime` to include date+time, but:
- Database column is type `time` (not `timestamp`)
- Needs format: `HH:MM:SS`
- Currently getting: `2025-10-16T12:35:00Z`

### 📝 Files Created for Analysis
1. `backend-api/html_today.html` - Full HTML page
2. `backend-api/json_today_complete.json` - Extracted JSON (has encoding issues)
3. Sporting Life API endpoint works better than HTML scraping!

### 🔧 Next Steps
1. Fix `off_time` parsing in `sportinglife.go` to extract ONLY "HH:MM:SS"
2. Restart server to reload with correct times
3. Verify Betfair matching works
4. Create database backup

### 📊 Database Summary
