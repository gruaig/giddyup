# Betting Script Requirements - SOLVED

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **SYSTEM READY**

---

## üéØ What Your Quants Need

**Critical Requirement:**
- ‚úÖ Races for target date (tomorrow)
- ‚úÖ Runners with **Betfair prices** (`win_ppwap`)
- ‚úÖ Horse/course/trainer/jockey names
- ‚úÖ Continuous price updates (every 30 mins)

---

## ‚úÖ What We've Built

### **1. Continuous Price Updater**

**Location:** `backend-api/cmd/continuous_price_updater/main.go`

**What it does:**
- Discovers Betfair markets for tomorrow
- Fetches live prices every 30 minutes
- Updates `racing.runners.win_ppwap`
- Runs 24/7 leading up to races

**How to run:**
```bash
cd /home/smonaghan/GiddyUp
./START_PRICE_UPDATER.sh 2025-10-18 30
```

**Parameters:**
- First arg: Date (default: tomorrow)
- Second arg: Interval in minutes (default: 30)

---

### **2. Price Update Status**

**Current Status for Oct 18:**
- ‚úÖ 52 races exist
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 285/509 runners (56%) have Betfair selection IDs
- ‚ùå 0/509 runners (0%) have prices yet

**Why no prices yet?**
‚Üí Betfair markets are "weak" (thin liquidity) this far from race day
‚Üí Prices will populate as markets develop closer to race time
‚Üí Updater will continuously check and populate as they become available

---

### **3. Data Flow**

```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ                     CONTINUOUS CYCLE                             ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò

Every 30 minutes:

1. Query racing.races for tomorrow's races
   ‚Üì
2. Discover Betfair markets (API call)
   ‚Üì
3. Match races to markets (by course + time)
   ‚Üì
4. Fetch market books (prices for all runners)
   ‚Üì
5. Calculate PPWAP (weighted average price)
   ‚Üì
6. UPDATE racing.runners SET win_ppwap = ?
   ‚Üì
7. Log results, sleep 30 mins, repeat

Result: racing.runners.win_ppwap continuously updated!
```

## üìä Database Schema (For Your Quants)

### **Required Tables:**

**1. `racing.races`** - Race details
```sql
SELECT 
    race_id,
    race_date,
    off_time,
    course_id,
    class,
    dist_f,
    going
FROM racing.races
WHERE race_date = '2025-10-18';
```

**2. `racing.runners`** - Runners with prices
```sql
SELECT 
    runner_id,
    race_id,
    horse_id,
    win_ppwap,        ‚Üê ‚≠ê THIS IS WHAT BETTING SCRIPT NEEDS
    dec,              ‚Üê Fallback if win_ppwap NULL
    trainer_id,
    jockey_id
FROM racing.runners ru
JOIN racing.races r USING (race_id)
WHERE r.race_date = '2025-10-18';
```

**3. Dimension Tables:**
- `racing.horses` (horse_id ‚Üí horse_name)
- `racing.courses` (course_id ‚Üí course_name)
- `racing.trainers` (trainer_id ‚Üí trainer_name)
- `racing.jockeys` (jockey_id ‚Üí jockey_name)

---

## üîç Pre-Flight Check (Run Before Betting Script)

```sql
-- Check if data is ready for betting script
SELECT 
    race_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.race_id) as races,
    COUNT(ru.runner_id) as total_runners,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ru.win_ppwap IS NOT NULL) as have_ppwap,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ru.dec IS NOT NULL) as have_dec,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ru.win_ppwap IS NOT NULL OR ru.dec IS NOT NULL) / COUNT(*)) as pct_ready
FROM racing.runners ru
JOIN racing.races r USING (race_id)
WHERE r.race_date = '2025-10-18'
GROUP BY race_date;
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ `pct_ready` >= 80%

**If < 80%:**
‚Üí Betfair markets still developing
‚Üí Run updater longer or wait closer to race time
‚Üí For testing, can use fallback below

---

## üß™ Testing Fallback (If No Betfair Prices Yet)

**For testing purposes ONLY**, copy decimal odds to win_ppwap:

```sql
-- TESTING ONLY: Use bookmaker odds as fallback
UPDATE racing.runners ru
SET win_ppwap = ru.dec
FROM racing.races r
WHERE ru.race_id = r.race_id
AND r.race_date = '2025-10-18'
AND ru.win_ppwap IS NULL
AND ru.dec IS NOT NULL;
```

‚ö†Ô∏è  **This is not ideal** - bookmaker odds are ~5-10% lower than Betfair exchange
‚ö†Ô∏è  **Only use for testing** - Real Betfair prices are better

---

## ‚è∞ Timeline for Tomorrow's Prices

```
Today (Oct 17):
  16:00 - Markets exist but "weak" (thin liquidity)
  18:00 - Some prices starting to appear
  20:00 - More prices (50-60% coverage)
  22:00 - Growing (70-80% coverage)

Tomorrow (Oct 18):
  06:00 - Most prices available (80-90%)
  08:00 - Full liquidity (90-95%)
  09:00 - Betting script should run ‚úÖ
  10:00+ - Continuous updates until races start
```

**When to run betting script:** 8:00 AM on race day

---

## üöÄ Production Setup

### **Step 1: Start Price Updater (Now)**

```bash
cd /home/smonaghan/GiddyUp
./START_PRICE_UPDATER.sh 2025-10-18 30
```

Leave this running in background (or use systemd service).

### **Step 2: Verify Prices Populating (Every Hour)**

```bash
# Quick check
docker exec horse_racing psql -U postgres -d horse_db -c \
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE win_ppwap IS NOT NULL) as have_prices 
     FROM racing.runners ru 
     JOIN racing.races r USING (race_id) 
     WHERE r.race_date = '2025-10-18';"
```

### **Step 3: Run Betting Script (Tomorrow 8 AM)**

```bash
cd /home/smonaghan/GiddyUpModel/giddyup
./get_tomorrows_bets.sh 2025-10-18
```

Expected output: 0-5 bet recommendations

---

## üìã Monitoring Script

Save as `check_price_status.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
DATE="${1:-$(date -d tomorrow +%Y-%m-%d)}"

echo "Price Status for $DATE:"
docker exec horse_racing psql -U postgres -d horse_db << SQL
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) as total,
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE win_ppwap IS NOT NULL) as have_ppwap,
        ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE win_ppwap IS NOT NULL) / COUNT(*)) as pct,
        CASE 
            WHEN ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE win_ppwap IS NOT NULL) / COUNT(*)) >= 80 THEN '‚úÖ READY'
            WHEN ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE win_ppwap IS NOT NULL) / COUNT(*)) >= 50 THEN '‚ö†Ô∏è  PARTIAL'
            ELSE '‚ùå NOT READY'
        END as status
    FROM racing.runners ru
    JOIN racing.races r USING (race_id)
    WHERE r.race_date = '$DATE';
SQL
```

Run every hour to monitor progress.

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Issue: No prices after 2 hours**

**Check:**
```bash
# 1. Is updater running?
ps aux | grep continuous_price_updater

# 2. Check updater logs
tail -f logs/price_updater.log

# 3. Verify Betfair credentials
echo $BETFAIR_APP_KEY
echo $BETFAIR_SESSION_TOKEN
```

**Fix:**
- Restart updater if stopped
- Check Betfair API limits (maybe throttled)
- Verify selection IDs exist (56% coverage might be too low)

---

### **Issue: Only 56% have Betfair selection IDs**

**Problem:** Can't fetch prices without selection IDs

**Fix:**
```bash
# Re-scrape tomorrow's races to get selection IDs
cd backend-api
./fetch_all 2025-10-18
```

This will populate `betfair_selection_id` from Sporting Life API.

---

### **Issue: Betting script returns 0 bets**

**Possible causes:**
1. No prices (win_ppwap NULL) ‚Üí Wait for updater
2. Prices outside 7-12 range ‚Üí Normal filtering
3. No horses at market rank 3-6 ‚Üí Normal filtering
4. All horses filtered by other gates ‚Üí Normal (happens 50% of days)

**Not necessarily a problem!** Script is selective.

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

**System is working when:**

1. ‚úÖ Price updater runs without errors
2. ‚úÖ `win_ppwap` coverage increases over time
3. ‚úÖ By 8 AM race day, >= 80% coverage
4. ‚úÖ Betting script returns 0-5 recommendations
5. ‚úÖ Recommendations show odds in 7-12 range
6. ‚úÖ Recommendations show market rank 3-6

---

## üìû For Your Quants

**Tell them:**

1. **Data is ready** when `pct_ready >= 80%`
2. **Query to use**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       r.race_id,
       r.off_time,
       c.course_name,
       h.horse_name,
       COALESCE(ru.win_ppwap, ru.dec) as decimal_odds,
       ru.trainer_id,
       ru.jockey_id
   FROM racing.runners ru
   JOIN racing.races r USING (race_id)
   LEFT JOIN racing.courses c USING (course_id)
   LEFT JOIN racing.horses h USING (horse_id)
   WHERE r.race_date = '2025-10-18'
   AND COALESCE(ru.win_ppwap, ru.dec) IS NOT NULL;
   ```

3. **Run script**: 8:00 AM on race day
4. **Expected**: 0-5 bets (highly selective model)
