## Why You're Seeing "-" in Your UI

### The Data IS in the Database!

I just verified via API:
```
GET /api/v1/races/809934 (Worcester Oct 15)
‚úÖ 10/10 horses have names
‚úÖ 8/10 horses have positions  
‚úÖ BTN showing (7, nk, 4 ¬Ω, 9)
```

### Why the UI Shows "-"

This is a **FRONTEND/BROWSER ISSUE**:

1. **Browser cache** - Your UI has old cached data showing "-"
2. **Hard refresh needed** - Press Ctrl+Shift+R
3. **Service worker** - May need to clear application cache

**The backend API is returning complete data!**

## Normal Behavior: Draws NULL for Jump Racing

**You asked about:** "Draw" showing "-"

**This is CORRECT!**

### Flat Racing (HAS draws):
```
Chelmsford City 15:00 - Flat Race
Pos  Horse           Draw  
1    Silent Song     3     ‚Üê Draw from starting stalls
2    Fast Runner     7
```

### Jump Racing (NO draws):
```
Worcester 13:22 - Handicap Chase  
Pos  Horse           Draw
1    Bebside Banter  -     ‚Üê No stalls in jump racing!
2    Henry Box Brown -
```

**Jump races** (hurdles/chases/NH Flat) don't have starting stalls - horses line up at a tape. So `draw` being NULL is **expected and correct**!

## Database Verification Commands

```bash
# Check total data
docker exec horse_racing psql -U postgres -d horse_db -c "
SELECT COUNT(*) as races FROM racing.races;"
# Result: 226,465 races ‚úÖ

# Check Oct 8 data
docker exec horse_racing psql -U postgres -d horse_db -c "
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM racing.races WHERE race_date = '2025-10-08';"
# Result: 37 races ‚úÖ

# Check horse names for Oct 15
docker exec horse_racing psql -U postgres -d horse_db -c "
SELECT ru.num, h.horse_name, ru.pos_raw 
FROM racing.runners ru 
LEFT JOIN racing.horses h ON h.horse_id = ru.horse_id 
WHERE race_date = '2025-10-15' LIMIT 10;"
# Result: All have names! ‚úÖ
```

## UI Debugging Steps

Since the data IS in the database and API:

### 1. Hard Refresh Browser
```
Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux)
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```

### 2. Clear Application Cache
```
F12 ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Clear Storage ‚Üí Clear Site Data
```

### 3. Check Network Tab
```
F12 ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Filter: /api/v1/races/
See if requests are being made
Check response data
```

### 4. Test API Directly
```bash
# Get a specific race
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/races/809934 | jq '.runners[] | {horse_name, pos_raw, trainer_name}'

# Should show all horse names!
```
