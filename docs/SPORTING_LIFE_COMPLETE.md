# Sporting Life API V2 Implementation Complete ✅

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: READY TO TEST

---

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Racing Post Completely Removed** ❌➡️✅
- ✅ Removed ALL Racing Post dependencies from codebase
- ✅ Sporting Life is now the ONLY data source
- ✅ Works for today, tomorrow, and historical dates

### 2. **2-Endpoint Merge Strategy** 🔄
We discovered the betting API alone wasn't enough. Now we fetch from **TWO** endpoints and merge:

#### Endpoint 1: `/api/horse-racing/race/{id}`
**Provides:**
- ✅ Jockey name + ID
- ✅ Trainer name + ID  
- ✅ Owner name + ID
- ✅ Horse age
- ✅ Weight (parsed to lbs)
- ✅ Form summary
- ✅ Headgear
- ✅ Draw/Stall number

#### Endpoint 2: `/api/horse-racing/v2/racing/betting/{id}`
**Provides:**
- ✅ **Betfair Selection ID** (critical for matching!)
- ✅ Best odds across all bookmakers
- ✅ Which bookmaker has best odds
- ✅ Each-way terms
- ✅ Non-runner status

### 3. **Parallel Today/Tomorrow Fetching** ⚡
- ✅ Thread 1: Fetches today's races
- ✅ Thread 2: Fetches tomorrow's races
- ✅ Both run simultaneously for speed
- ✅ ~50% faster startup

### 4. **Database Changes** 💾
Added new columns to `racing.runners`:
```sql
- betfair_selection_id bigint  -- Direct Betfair matching (no name normalization needed!)
- best_odds double precision   -- Best decimal odds
- best_bookmaker varchar(100)  -- Which bookmaker
```

### 5. **Improved Type Handling** 🔧
Fixed JSON parsing issues:
- ✅ `cloth_number` can be string OR int
- ✅ `headgear` can be array OR object OR null
- ✅ Handles all Sporting Life API variations

### 6. **Caching** 📦
- ✅ Saves complete race data to `/data/sportinglife/{date}.json`
- ✅ Subsequent loads instant (no API calls)
- ✅ Today's data cached for fast re-loads

---

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### On Startup
1. **Check missing data** → Identifies gaps
2. **Parallel fetch** → Today + Tomorrow simultaneously
3. **For each race:**
   - Call `/race/{id}` → Get jockey/trainer/owner
   - Call `/v2/racing/betting/{id}` → Get odds + Betfair ID
   - **Merge the two** → Complete dataset
4. **Cache results** → Fast next time
5. **Insert to database** → With all fields populated

### API Flow (Per Race)
```
/racing/racecards/{date}
    ↓
  Get 44 race IDs
    ↓
For each race:
    ├─ /race/{id}            (jockey, trainer, owner, form...)
    ├─ /v2/racing/betting/{id}  (odds, betfairSelectionId...)
    └─ MERGE → Complete race with runners
```

## 📊 Data Quality

### Tomorrow's Data Will Now Have:
| Field | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Horse Name | ✅ YES |
| Jockey | ✅ YES |
| Trainer | ✅ YES |
| Owner | ✅ YES |
| Age | ✅ YES |
| Weight | ✅ YES (parsed to lbs) |
| Form | ✅ YES |
| Headgear | ✅ YES |
| Draw | ✅ YES |
| **Betfair Selection ID** | ✅ **YES** (🎯 KEY!) |
| **Best Odds** | ✅ **YES** |
| **Best Bookmaker** | ✅ **YES** |

---

## 🎯 Betfair Matching - Now EASY!

**Before**: Had to match by normalized horse name (error-prone)
**Now**: Direct `betfair_selection_id` lookup!

```sql
-- Old way (unreliable)
SELECT * FROM runners 
WHERE LOWER(horse_name) = LOWER('Some Horse Name');

-- New way (perfect match!)
SELECT * FROM runners 
WHERE betfair_selection_id = 46013800;
```

## 📝 Verbose Logging

New progress messages every 5-10 races:
```
[AutoUpdate] 📅 [Thread 1] Fetching TODAY (2025-10-16)...
[AutoUpdate] 📅 [Thread 2] Fetching TOMORROW (2025-10-17)...
[AutoUpdate] ✓ Upserted 7 courses, 523 horses, 287 trainers, 245 jockeys
[AutoUpdate] 📝 Progress: 20/53 races (38%), 240 runners so far
[AutoUpdate] ✅ [Thread 1] TODAY loaded: 53 races, 632 runners
[AutoUpdate] ✅ [Thread 2] TOMORROW loaded: 44 races, 402 runners
[AutoUpdate] ✅ Parallel load complete
```

---

## 🐛 Known Issues Fixed
1. ✅ `cloth_number` type mismatch → Now handles string/int
2. ✅ `headgear` type mismatch → Now handles array/object/null
3. ✅ Missing jockey/trainer/owner → Now fetches from `/race/{id}`
4. ✅ No Betfair selection ID → Now captured from betting API
5. ✅ Racing Post 403 errors → Completely removed

## 🧪 Next Steps to Test

1. **Start the server** (kill any existing processes first):
   ```bash
   pkill -f "bin/api"
   cd /home/smonaghan/GiddyUp
   source settings.env
   cd backend-api
   ./bin/api
   ```

2. **Watch the logs**:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/server.log
   ```

3. **Verify tomorrow's data**:
   ```bash
   # After server loads, check database
   SELECT 
     r.off_time,
     r.race_name,
     ru.horse_name,
     ru.jockey_name,
     ru.trainer_name,
     ru.betfair_selection_id,
     ru.best_odds,
     ru.best_bookmaker
   FROM racing.races r
   JOIN racing.runners ru ON ru.race_id = r.race_id
   WHERE r.race_date = '2025-10-17'
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

4. **Test Betfair matching**:
   - Use `betfair_selection_id` for direct matching
   - No more name normalization needed!
